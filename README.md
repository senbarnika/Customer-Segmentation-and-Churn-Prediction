### üß© **Customer Segmentation for Banks using Unsupervised Machine Learning**

### üìå *Overview*

Customer segmentation is a foundational practice in data-driven marketing, financial analytics, and strategic decision-making. This project leverages unsupervised machine learning, particularly K-Means clustering, to classify banking customers into distinct, behaviorally homogeneous groups. </t>

Using demographic and transactional attributes, the model identifies underlying patterns and clusters that traditional analysis might overlook. These insights enable financial institutions to: </t>

* Design highly personalized marketing strategies </t>
* Develop targeted financial products and offers </t>
* Predict customer needs and behaviors more accurately </t>
* Optimize customer acquisition, engagement, and retention efforts </t>
