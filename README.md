### 🧩 **Customer Segmentation for Banks using Unsupervised Machine Learning**

### 📌 *Overview*

Customer segmentation is a foundational practice in data-driven marketing, financial analytics, and strategic decision-making. This project leverages unsupervised machine learning, particularly K-Means clustering, to classify banking customers into distinct, behaviorally homogeneous groups. </t>

Using demographic and transactional attributes, the model identifies underlying patterns and clusters that traditional analysis might overlook. These insights enable financial institutions to: </t>

* Design highly personalized marketing strategies </t>
* Develop targeted financial products and offers </t>
* Predict customer needs and behaviors more accuratel </t>y
* Optimize customer acquisition, engagement, and retention efforts </t>

### 🧠 *Problem Statement*
“How can a bank extract actionable customer segments from high-dimensional customer data to drive personalization, optimize marketing efforts, and improve customer lifetime value?” </t>

To address this, the project implements an unsupervised learning pipeline that processes raw customer data, applies clustering algorithms, and visualizes segmented customer groups to uncover actionable business insights. </t>
